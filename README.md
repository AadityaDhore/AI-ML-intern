This is a code in python that convert a statement from English to Hinglish

## Steps to execute code
Input: The program takes an English sentence as input. For example, let's take the input sentence: "I was waiting for my bag."

Translation: The program then goes through the input sentence word by word and translates each English word into its corresponding Hinglish equivalent. Hinglish is a mix of Hindi and English, often using English words written in a way that reflects their pronunciation in Hindi.

For example, translating "I" to Hinglish might be simply "Main," and "my" might become "mera." So, the translation might look like: "Main mera bag dhoond raha tha"

Output: The translated Hinglish sentence is generated as output. In our case, the output would be: "Main mera bag dhoond raha tha"


Implementation: The program likely uses a predefined dictionary or mapping of English words to their Hinglish counterparts. It could use conditional statements or lookups in a data structure like a dictionary to perform the translation

Performance Evaluation : the performance/accuracy  of the model is defined by the actual conversion of words from engish to hindi expect some words that keeps as it is in English 
for e.g :- the word "Bag" keep same as "Bag" after translating into hinglish
